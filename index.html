		<h1>Embedded Systems and Communication Protocols</h1>
		<p>This text might be an <b>introduction</b> to the rest of the page.
		   And if the <b>page</b> is a long one it might be <i>split</i> up into <i>several</i> sub-headings. </p>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Embedded system is a system that has software embedded into 
		   the hardware and is dedicated to a particular part of a computer application regarding one or many specific features.</p>
		<h2>System Architectures</h2>
		<p>Before discussing different types of system, it is important 
		   to understand that a system essentially consists of data and instruction units which can loosely defined as human memory and brain respectively. From there, the idea is to access data, i.e. knowledge, to analyze and make instruction.</p>
		<p>As previously mentioned, embedded systems are classified as 
		   MPU and MCU with primary differences which are important in design including application perspective, connectivity standpoints, power consumption and whether it is consumer electronic or industrial automation. More on that, detailed analysis by Product Managers from Microchip - a microcontroller manufacturer.</p>
		<h3>Testing other features</h3>
		<p>On the 4<sup>th</sup> of September you will learn about E=MC<sup

		<p>The amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere grew by 2ppm in 2009<sub>1</sub>.</p>
		<p>The Earth <br />gets one hundred tons heavier every day<br /> due 
		   to the falling space dust.</p>
		<p>Venus is the only planet that rotates clockwise.</p>

		<p>Jupiter is bigger than all the other planets combined.</p>
